# gspca-kinect2

Linux kernel driver for the "Kinect for Windows 2" sensor.

## Requirements ##
* Linux 3.x+
* ffmpeg

## Install
Run this command in a terminal emulator.
Make sure you have ffmpeg installed, or this script will not proceed.
```
wget -q -O - https://github.com/tduck973564/gspca-kinect2/raw/master/install-webcam.sh | sudo sh
```
## Build 

Build
```
$ make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build  M=`pwd` SRCROOT=`pwd` clean modules  
```

If you already installed original gspca_main driver, remove it first.
```
$ sudo /sbin/rmmod gspca_main
```

Then, install drivers.
```
$ sudo /sbin/modprobe videodev
$ sudo /sbin/insmod ./gspca_main.ko  
$ sudo /sbin/insmod ./gspca_kinect2.ko  
```

## Usage

This driver provides two v4l2 interfaces per a single kinect sensor; color camera is mapped to /dev/video0, and depth camera is mapped to /dev/video1. If you have two or more sensors, they shall be mappaed to /dev/videoX, where X are (2*n) for n-th color and (2*n+1) for n-th depth.

### Capture color video

```
$ ffmpeg  -framerate 30 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0  test.avi  
$ mplayer test.avi  
```

### View live color/depth video

I wrote an open source library, named libk4w2. See https://github.com/yoshimoto/libk4w2/ for details.

### Misc

```
$ v4l-info /dev/video0  
$ v4l-info /dev/video1  
$ v4l2ucp preview  
```
